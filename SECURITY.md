# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I am new to development on my own, I am always grateful to learn from others. No first version has been deployed yet, but as it is, I will update this readme.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a security volnerability, please do anything at all to get my attention 
and I will do my best to learn about the subject and correct it. 
I am unaware at this time what the usual practices are, but be it a Pull request, comment/message if that is allowed, or an email at realZEROFIVENINEmattdatgm.com (the letters are actually numbers, 059. the at is the actual at symbol, and gm is gmail). 
If you put something in the subject line about what you have noticed I would be so grateful and happy to learn. 

I am planning on setting up some type of ASP .NET core backend deal, a .net maui app with hopefully some tweaks made in x code to make it great on iOS, and a great website (proabably blazor? but who knows at this point). 
My background is backend API development with different architecture patterns like kafka messaging, using different databases, etc. I appreciate any and all feedback, thanks again, Matt.

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
